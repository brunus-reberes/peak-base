PEAK is a multi-agent system framework which helps the users develop, monitor, analyse and maintain ecosystem of heterogeneous agent communities. This ecosystem is  where various multi-agent systems can coexist, interact and share resources between them. 
This framework is based on [SPADE](https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

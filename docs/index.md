# PEAK - Python-based framework for hEterogeneous Agent Communities

## What is it?
PEAK is a Python framework which aims to help the users build, manage, analyse and maintain multi-agent systems which become part of a unique ecosystem. This ecosystem is a system where various multi-agent systems can coexist at the same time allowing for an easy management and analysis. 
This framework is an extension of the [SPADE](https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework which was built using the [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) protocol. 

## Main Features
PEAK framework focus on two things: help build multi-agent system with ease, eliminating the use of many boilerplates and adding usefull functionalities, and help the users to manage, analyse and monitor interactivly every single aspect of each multi-agent system inside the ecosystem.
Because of these, PEAK was devided in two main components: the PEAK Core, where the tools to build and run agents are, and the PEAK Dashboard, and option tool for monitoring and analysing the multi-agent systems created with PEAK.

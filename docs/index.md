# PEAK - Python-based framework for hEterogeneous Agent Communities

PEAK is a framework that helps users build, manage, analyze and maintain a multi-agent ecosystem. This ecosystem is where different multi-agent systems can coexist and share resources with it each other in a easy manner. 

PEAK is based on [SPADE](https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework, which was built using the [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) protocol.
